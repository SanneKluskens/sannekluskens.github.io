I am an entrepeneur motivated to change the worldwide waste of clothing into a sustainable cyclus. With my company See You Tomorrow Studios I provide sustainable clothing made from used items. 

Aside from sustainability, the focus of See You Tomorrow Studios lies in fashion. We provide timeless clothing that can be used for long time. The contrast with the fashion industry nowadays is big. We fight against the doomed cycles of fast fashion while also providing beautiful clothes.
